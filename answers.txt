What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

This file tells git which files are to be ignored.
These files are not intended for source control.
Eg: compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc
For a java project, it should include :
*.class
*.log
*.ctxt
.mtj.tmp/
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar
hs_err_pid*

What does fast-forward in Git mean?

Git does what is called a fast forward when you merge a branch that is ahead of your checked-out branch.
Eg: If you are in branchA and changes are made to branchB and both are to be merged, branchB is ahead of branchA at
the point of merge. BranchA had no commits.
Git identifies this and fast forwards branchA's pointer to the same as branchB

Why should you have different branches?
Integrating the different contexts and keeping track of each one manually is tedious. Git stores data as a series of snippets.
A branch is such a snippet that represents a single context and keeps it separate from the others.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
One repository
